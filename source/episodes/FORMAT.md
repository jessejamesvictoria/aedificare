# Episode scripts

An episode is one file here, `source/episodes/<slug>.md`, cut into a film by
`tools/episode.mjs` (CLAUDE.md, override 8). The narration is written in the
film voice (`source/film/voice.md`); the shots are tagged inline, exactly
where the cut falls. The words are the script and the tags are the edit.

```
node tools/episode.mjs check  source/episodes/<slug>.md [--online]   facts, sources, tags
node tools/episode.mjs sheet  source/episodes/<slug>.md              the footage shopping list
node tools/episode.mjs all    source/episodes/<slug>.md              narrate if the words changed, then render
```

## The process, every episode

1. **Story.** One tech-and-money story with one number in it.
2. **Research.** Primary sources first: filings, releases, transcripts, the
   committee's own hearing video. Every figure and quote gets a source line.
3. **Script.** Written here, in the voice, with shot tags.
4. **Check.** `check --online` passes: every sentence with a number cites a
   source, every quote's words are on its source page.
5. **Sheet.** `sheet` lists every clip, footage shot and gag the script asks
   for, with the file name each one needs. The owner finds them and attaches
   them to the GitHub Release `footage-<slug>`.
6. **Render.** The `episode` workflow pulls the footage, narrates, renders,
   and files the film under the Release `film-ep-<slug>`. A shot still
   missing renders as a slate naming what it needs, so an early render is
   the animatic.
7. **Upload.** From the release, with `sheet.txt`; or `upload-youtube.mjs`.
   The Short (`render --short`, the chapters named in `short:`, tall, with
   the end card) goes up the same day with `sheet-short.txt`; Shorts are a
   separate feed, not a trailer.

```

## Sources

```
# Sources

- s1 | Publisher | Title of the document | 2024-02-08 | https://…
- s2 | …
```

In the narration, `[s1]` after a sentence cites it; `[s1, s2]` cites both.
Markers are never read aloud. `check` fails any sentence carrying a digit
without one, any marker naming no source, any source never cited. Numbers
assembled from two sources or two dates say so in the sentence.

## Chapters

`## Heading` starts a YouTube chapter. Headings are not read aloud.

## Shot tags

A tag cuts at the next word spoken and holds until the next cut. Two cut
tags on the same word is an error (the first would never be seen). A cut
tag on a line of its own is a beat of its own: it holds in silence for
`hold: 2.7` seconds (the default, three of the kit's beats) and the
narration resumes after it, which is how a title drops.

| Tag | What it puts on screen | Who makes it |
|---|---|---|
| `[[footage#id: what it shows \| find: where to look]]` | real footage, silent, graded to the channel look | owner |
| `[[gag#id: what it shows \| find: …]]` | a comedy beat, silent, ungraded so it pops | owner |
| `[[clip#id: who says what \| say: "the exact words" \| find: … \| 6s]]` on its own line | a person saying it, **with their sound**; the narration waits | owner |
| `[[quote: s3 \| "exact words" \| NAME, ROLE, DATE \| hl: the words to highlight]]` | the quote typeset, the highlighter sweeping the key words | computed |
| `[[map: Hsinchu 24.8,121.0 > Phoenix 33.4,-112.1 \| label]]` | the world in Bottle, the route drawn in Acid | computed |
| `[[chart: bars \| Takeaway title \| src: s1, s2 \| unit: % \| Label=5.10 \| Label=9.75*]]` | a chart that builds up, the starred row last and in Acid, the source on screen | computed |
| `[[fig: $18,214 \| PER RADIO]]` | a figure card | computed |
| `[[card: SAME PHYSICS.]]` | a statement card | computed |
| `[[title: The $18,214 Radio]]` | the title card with the mark | computed |
| `[[over: $5.1M \| USAF · FEB 2024]]` | type over the current shot, no cut, until the voice has said it: the end of the sentence that says its last number (or the sentence it lands in), at least 3.6 s, never past the next tag | computed |

## Charts

Screen time carries the argument: when a number has a context (a history,
a comparison, a flow of money), it goes on a chart, not a card. The forms,
by the job the data does (`tools/lib/chart.mjs`):

| Form | Job | Data parts |
|---|---|---|
| `bars` | compare a few magnitudes | `Label=9.75` |
| `range` | low to high per row: the rates of an issue, a band | `Jun 2021=2.125..5.25` |
| `stack` | the parts of one whole | `Due 2034=438.75` |
| `timeline` | dated events | `2026-10-01=Last $10B` |
| `flow` | money or control between parties | `SoftBank > OpenAI=$30B` |
| `line` | one series over time, `ref: 5.10 TREASURY` for a reference line | `2026-04=8.5` |

Rules the checker holds: every chart cites its sources (`src:`), which
appear on screen; one row is the story (`*`), so one mark is Acid and the
rest Malachite; seven rows at most. Rules it cannot: the title is the
takeaway ("Every sale has cost more than the last"), not the axis name;
`sub:` says what is measured; `note:` says what the chart cannot (yen and
dollar rates are not directly comparable); a value keeps the precision its
source prints (5.10, not 5.1); `Label=400 (400+)` shows display text.
A chart builds context first and lands its starred row on the word that
says its value: the renderer finds that word in the narration's own
timestamps (digits only, so "9.75%," and "114 dollars and 50 cents" both
match) and times the build to finish on it, because narration in sync
with the picture is the largest comprehension effect in the research
(source/channel/brief-2026-09-26.md). `check` warns when no word spoken
while the chart is on screen (from its tag to the next cut) says the
starred value; that chart falls back to building inside its shot, which
shows the point before the voice says it. `render` warns the same, past
five rows (three in a Short), and names every computed shot that stands
still past 14.4 s (four bars of four beats), counted from when its build
or highlighter finishes: a static screen gets another cut, a chart
building in step with the voice is not static.

A chart that comes back after a cutaway is a second tag, and each
appearance stars the number said while it is up: first July's two
prices with `$554.72*`, then after the figure the same two rows and the
backstop's `$555.00*`. Rows the previous chart of the same form already
showed (bars and range, same label, same value) are held: drawn from the
first frame, so only the new row builds and it lands on its word.

`#id` names the file the owner supplies (`footage/<id>.mp4`); without one,
the id is the first five words of the description. `raw` on a footage tag
(`| raw: yes`) skips the grade.

## What the owner supplies, and the rules for it

- **Public domain first**: US federal government video (White House, the
  committees' own hearing streams, the House and Senate floor, DVIDS, NASA),
  the Library of Congress, Prelinger and Internet Archive films, pre-1931
  films, Wikimedia Commons files marked public domain.
- **Anything else is fair use and a claim risk**: a news broadcast, a film,
  a meme. Keep it to the seconds the point needs (a gag is one to three
  seconds), put commentary on either side of it, and log it in
  `footage/credits.txt`. A Content ID claim usually moves that video's ad
  money; it rarely strikes.
- **Never** a clip that makes a real person appear to say or do something
  they did not. The narrator is synthetic and never imitates a real voice.

## Credits

`footage/credits.txt`, one line per file: `id: source, licence`. The
description carries them under "Footage:".
